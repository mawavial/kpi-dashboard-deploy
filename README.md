## Hello
This is a simple dashboard using materialUI and nextjs.
Nextjs is a server side rendering framework for react.

```bash
cd ~/kpi-dashboard-deploy
```

Then you can install the project dependencies:

npm install
```

Finally, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```


## To-Do list:
* Wrap up cards
* Create reducers

* Prettier corrections
* Unit Testing
* Improve lint
* Install husky
* Login logic


## Deployed on Vercel
